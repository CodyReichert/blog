I've used several static site generators for projects in the past. As a matter
of fact, our company website(link) is written with Hakyll, a static site generator
written in Haskell. So when it came time to write this blog, I wanted to try something and
I had a few requirements:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='row'&gt;
&lt;div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6'&gt;
&lt;ul style='padding-top:15px'&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy integration with modern front end tools, like Bower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy integration with alterntive markups, like Haml.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A minimalistic structure approach (don't tell me what to do!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Good documentation. I didn't want to spend a lot of time learning
how to walk again.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6'&gt;
&lt;img src='/images/middlemanbanner.jpg' style='border-radius: 4px;margin-bottom:10px;'&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The obvious choice was Jekyll, but I didn't really want to go the Ruby route. Well,
at least no until I found Middleman. Middleman is a static site generator written in
Ruby, and I must say, it has been absolutely pleasant to work with. My main goal
during this site's development was to focus more on the front-end code and
toolkits, and Middleman lends itself to that generously.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this article I'll cover getting a statically generated blog up and running quickly using Middleman.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installing Middleman&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Getting started with Middleman is pretty straight forward. It is installed with the RubyGems
package manager. Run the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ gem install middleman&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Middleman Scaffolds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Once you have that installed, there is a pretty nice scaffolding tool to create a new site skeleton.
Running the following will get you started with a new Middleman skeleton site with all the default options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ middleman init your_project_name
$ bundle install&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A New Middleman Scaffold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By default, the middleman layout files are in Erb with CSS and JavaScript. One of my main goals
during the site development was to get proficient with new tools. So Erb, CSS, and Javascript
were dropped, and Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript were brought in. I also included Bower to handle
front end package management.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When I first got started I created and deleted many different projects, naturally. When I got tired
of change the Erb files to Haml, CSS to Sass, JavaScript to CoffeeScript, I decided to create a
scaffold template so I cold generate a new project with these implementations already done. You can
see the repo here. Basically, this is a quick start to getting a blog set up using Haml, Sass,
CoffeeScript, and Bower. You can get started with it by cloning the repository:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;$ mkdir -p ~/.middleman/
$ git clone https://github.com/CodyReichert/middleman-hamlsasscoffeeblog.git ~/.middleman/hamlsasscoffeeblog
$ middleman init project_name --template=hamlsasscoffeeblog
$ cd project_name
$ bundle install &amp;&amp; bower install
$ bundle exec middleman server&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first command we run is to create the directory where Middleman looks for template scaffolds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we clone the repo into our new directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we initialize a new project. We pass the template flag to use the new scaffold we just installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move into our new project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use `bundle install` to install the Gem dependencies, and `bower install` to install the front-end&lt;/li&gt;
dependencies. (By default I use jQuery as an example, it has no dependents so you can keep or remove it)
6. Run the middleman server
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Great! So you now you can navigate your browser to localhost:4567 and check out your new site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration Options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The config.rb file in the root directory of the project is where all the magic happens. Middleman comes with
some great options out of the box including pretty URL's, build settings, and blog settings. Here's a few cool
things you can do with your new blog.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Blog Permalinks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can change your permalink very easily, and most of the work is done for you. Look for this line in your config:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;# blog permalink with no file extension
blog.permalink = "{year}/{month}/{day}/{title}"
# blog permalink with file extension
blog.permalink = "{year}/{month}/{day}/{title}.html"&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can set your permalinks using the interpolates variables. There are options for wether you are using file
extensions or not.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This post is a work in progress. And I want to go over some of these topic in more detail. Check back for an
updated post or shoot me an email.o
